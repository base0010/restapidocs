Becoming a Semahpore Network Host
=================================
What Is A Semaphore Host? 
A Semaphore Host is an individual or entity that deploys physical nodes and radio hardware to provide Semaphore Network decentralized internet services to end-users. 

What Are The Physical Prerequisites to Become a Host? 
Hosts provide three basic types of physical world capital that host's provide to the network; this capital is utilized as dentralized internet services by network subscribers.

Physical Space:
This is usually outdoor space high up and with the clearest Line-of-Sight to potential end-users. "Vertical Infrastructure"

Internet Access:
A host's Semaphore unit will need a general outbound internet connection. Please check with your providers ToS 

Radio Hardware:
Various combinations of radio hardware and deployments are left up to hosts. 
Semaphore Network supports BOTH COTS (common off the shelf) and FOSS (FPGA + SDR) radio frontends for hosting network coverage.
You are free to choose what works best for your wallet, local DAO community and radio frequency regulations; up to and including running completely FOSS hardware. 


Generally speaking any eNodeB hardware (cellular equivilant of an access point) is compatible with the Semaphore Network Protocol. We do not gatekeep across hardware, locality or RF frontend. 

List of Tested eNodeB Hardware: 
Baicells Nova227 (CBRS)
Baicells Nova223 (CBRS)

BladeRF xA9 (isolated testing purposes only)
ANTSDR (presumptive possible)
USRPs  (presumptive possible)

See Physical Setup. 

Software and On-Chain Requisites.

Host's can use the srsRAN EPC fork to connect to their chosen eNodeB. They will need to register through the Host DApp and create a keypair to use when running the network (this can be changed out).    



Becoming a Semahpore Network User
=================================

You can use the Semaphore Network as a user on both cellular (LTE/5G) and WiFi (soon) protocols. 

Using the Semaphore Network Cellular Service:
To become a Semaphore network subscriber you will need to use the Subscriber DApp to 

Requirements:
Obtaining or creating a Semaphore Network ETHSim; this will serve as a hardware wallet and contains the authentication keys that will subscribers on the network
